{"body":"iOS Localizer\r\n=============\r\n\r\nA Ruby gem that makes it easy to localize iOS applications. \r\n\r\nThis gem uses [Google Translate's REST API] to translate all the Localizable.strings \r\nfiles generated by XCode to the file's respective language.\r\n\r\nCreated by Daniel Olshansky ([@olshansky]) and Amandeep Grewal ([@amandeep]).\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n###  1. API Access \r\n\r\nGoogle's translating services cost $20 per 1M characters so you must get\r\na valid key prior to using this gem. \r\n\r\nGo to the [Google APIs Console]. Under *Services*, enable *Translate API* and complete the required \r\nforms to enable payments.\r\n\r\n### 2. Localizing your strings \r\n\r\nI would also personally recommend that all the strings displayed to the user\r\nshould be removed from any .nib files and added via code to make your \r\nproject more systematic and easier to manage.\r\n\r\nAny string displayed to the User must be formatted in the following way:\r\n``` \r\nNSLocalizedString(@\"String to be displayed\", @\"Comment about the string\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Localizable.strings files\r\n\r\nCreate a new Strings file: \r\n  - Go to *File > New > File*\r\n  - On the left hand side go to Resource (iOS or OS X depending on the application)\r\n    and choose *Strings File*. Call the file *Localizable.strings*.\r\n\r\nSelect the new Localizable.strings file and make it localizable by clicking the *[Make localized]* button.\r\n\r\n### 4. Adding new languages\r\n\r\nAdding an additional language is very simple with XCode. [This image] shows you where \r\nyou can choose to add or remove  languages that application should be localized for depending on who your target \r\ndemographic. \r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n```\r\ngem install ios_localizer\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n* Navigate into your project's directory in terminal:\r\n\r\n   i.e. ```cd ~/Documents/workspace/ExampleProjectName/ ```\r\n\r\n* The most common use case of the gem would then be:\r\n\r\n   i.e. ```ios_localizer -k YoureKeyHere1234567890 ```\r\n\r\n* If the source language is not english, you can specify it as follows:\r\n\r\n   i.e. ```ios_localizer -k YoureKeyHere1234567890 -s nl```\r\n   \r\n   where `nl` is the ISO 639 representation of the source language\r\n\r\n* If you have already run the script but added a new localization \r\n   language afterwards, you can avoid retranslating (and wasting your credit) as follows:\r\n\r\n   i.e. ```ios_localizer -k YoureKeyHere1234567890 -n la -n lb -n lc```\r\n   \r\n   where `la`, `lb` and `lc` are the ISO 639 representations of the languages you \r\n   would like to avoid translating to (given that you have added them in \r\n   XCode under Localizations).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nAny and all pull requests are welcome!\r\n\r\nCopyright and license\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Daniel Olshansky & Amandeep Grewal\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n\r\n  [@olshansky]: http://twitter.com/olshansky\r\n  [@amandeep]: http://twitter.com/amandeep\r\n  [Google APIs Console]: https://code.google.com/apis/console/\r\n  [Google Translate's REST API]: https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/using_rest\r\n  [This image]: https://github.com/Olshansk/ios_localizer/raw/master/images/Add%20Language.png\r\n  [Make localized]: https://github.com/Olshansk/ios_localizer/raw/master/images/Localize.png","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
